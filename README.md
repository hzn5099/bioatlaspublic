# BioAtlas
Virtual slide technology enables users to view high-resolution imagery with a significantly reduced download time.
Virtual slides are panned and magnified in a manner similar to a traditional microscope but offer constant context with
respect to the remainder of the slide, labeling, comparison, and collaborative possibilities beyond the limitations of
physical microscopy. Glass slides can be imaged in their entirety and saved as virtual slides in the computer database. The
repository contains the imagery system for the Zebrafish atlas.
