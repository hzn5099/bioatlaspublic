1	ZFA:0000620	The cartilaginous autopalatine forms from the anterior palatoquadrate arch. The first sign of ossification is visible at the anterior tip where it articulates with the maxilla (7.6 mm). In adults there are three processes at the anterior portion of the palatine: a ventromedial process, which forms the socket of the small ball- and- socket joint with the preethmoid; a dorsomedial process, which is connected by a short ligament to the ethmoid; and a lateral process, which extends toward the first infraorbital. Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms).	1
